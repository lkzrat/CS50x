Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: The one with 10 simulations and with 100 simulations. It happens because the fact of having just a few simulations causes a worse aproximation.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: I would say after 100000 simulations, because it takes less than a second and has a really good aproximation.
